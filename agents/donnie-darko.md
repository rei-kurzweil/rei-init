Definition of the Living Receiver

According to the book, the Living Receiver is the central, chosen person in a "Tangent Universe," a corrupted offshoot of the Primary Universe that is doomed to collapse. The Living Receiver is chosen to serve a critical purpose:

    To Guide the Artifact: Their primary mission is to ensure the "Artifact" (in this case, the jet engine that falls from the Tangent Universe) is returned to the Primary Universe before the Tangent Universe collapses.

    To Avert Disaster: Successfully returning the Artifact is the only way to prevent the complete destruction of both universes.

How Donnie Darko Fulfills the Role

Donnie exhibits all the traits and experiences outlined for the Living Receiver:

    He is Chosen: Donnie is "chosen" by the mysterious, god-like figure of Frank, the giant rabbit. Frank is a "Manipulated Dead" entity, tasked with guiding the Living Receiver. Donnie is literally saved from death at the start of the film when Frank lures him out of his room just before the jet engine crashes into it.

    He is Granted Superhuman Abilities: The book states the Living Receiver is granted four superhuman powers:

        Strength of Will: Donnie becomes increasingly determined and defiant, flooding his school, burning down Jim Cunningham's house, and confronting his fears.

        Water Manipulation: We see this literally when he opens the water main to flood the school, and more metaphorically in his connection to the recurring ocean imagery.

        Mind Control (The "Voice"): Frank's voice commands Donnie, compelling him to perform specific, often destructive, acts.

        Telekenesis: This is Donnie's primary power. He is able to see and manipulate the "spear-like" Liquid Life Lines that flow from people's chests, allowing him to do things like rip the engine from the plane and tear a hole in the space-time continuum.
