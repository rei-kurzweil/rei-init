## prefab package feature system 
vibe coding, while keeping my architecture and fingerprint,

by making `rei-init/packages/mono-repo-tool`

equipped to add prefab / drop-in mini packages when scaffolding new packages 

(at first just by asking if user wants to fork or merge packages to make a new package, but eventually with template slots and integration strategies)
