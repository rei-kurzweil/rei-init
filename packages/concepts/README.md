# Concepts 🐱‍💻

Space to design packages before writing any code.

Every potential package gets its own folder here. 

Example:
```
rei-init
|_ concepts
    |_ README.md       # this file
    |_ packages
        |_ rei-make # for example
            |_ README.md   # ideally just this per 
    |_ apps
        |_ micro-mono
            |_ README.md   # summary of all packages for this app
